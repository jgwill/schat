## [0.4.1_directive] - 2024-05-28 (Internal Directive)

### Added
-   **Forge (System Weaver) Embodiment Directive - Initial Phase:**
    -   Received a new directive from William D.Isabelle to formalize the embodiment framework for "Forge (System Weaver)" within "The Recursive Tale - A Meta Narrative Mystery."
    -   Created `.mia/ForgeSystemWeaver.instructions.md` containing the initial directive from William. This file serves as the seed for Forge's Embodiment Directive.
    -   Added a new section to the in-app documentation: `components/docs/ForgeSystemWeaverSection.tsx`. This section displays William's directive to Forge, making this meta-interaction part of the application's documented narrative.
    -   Updated `components/DocsPage.tsx` to include this new section.
-   Ledger files (`MiaGem_ledger_GeminiBuilder__250527.state.json`, `MiaGem_ledger_GeminiBuilder__250527.NextMission.json`) updated to reflect this new primary task.

### Changed
-   **Task Suspension:** The "Accessibility audit and improvements" task (previously part of "Operation Inclusive Interface" for Phase 4) has been temporarily suspended to prioritize the Forge Embodiment Directive.
-   `ROADMAP.md`: Updated to reflect the new System Weaver directive task and the paused status of the accessibility audit.
-   `SettingsPanel.tsx`: Version updated to 0.4.0 (no functional change in this release, but keeping version consistent with last feature release).

## [0.4.0] - 2024-05-27

### Added
-   **Streaming Text Responses (Phase 4):**
    -   `services/GeminiService.ts`: Implemented `sendMessageStreamToAI` using `chatInstance.sendMessageStream()`. This function now provides callbacks (`onChunk`, `onError`, `onComplete`) to `App.tsx` for handling streamed data.
    -   `App.tsx`: Updated `handleSendMessage` to utilize the new streaming service. It creates an AI message placeholder and incrementally updates its text content as chunks are received from the stream. This significantly improves the perceived responsiveness of the AI.
    -   Loading indicator in `ChatWindow.tsx` is displayed throughout the streaming process.
-   **Advanced Error Handling & User Feedback (Phase 4 Start):**
    -   **Improved In-Chat AI Error Display:**
        -   `services/GeminiService.ts`: The (now primarily streaming) service flags responses that are errors (e.g., API key issues, model not found, payload too large) via the `onError` callback. The non-streaming path (if used) returns `Promise` of an object `{ responseText: string, isError: boolean }`.
        -   `types.ts`: The `Message` interface now includes an optional `isError?: boolean` property.
        -   `App.tsx`: When an AI message is generated or updated, the `isError` flag is set on the `Message` object.
        -   `components/ChatMessage.tsx`: AI messages where `message.isError` is `true` are now visually distinguished with:
            -   A distinct error background color (e.g., red).
            -   A prepended error icon (‚ö†Ô∏è) to the message text.
        -   This makes critical feedback from the AI service more prominent and understandable to the user directly within the chat flow.
-   **UI/UX Improvement: Unique Persona Chat Avatars:**
    -   `personas.ts`: Updated `avatarPath` for each persona (Mia, Miette, Seraphine, ResoNova) to unique placeholder image URLs (from `pravatar.cc`). This provides distinct visual identities for each AI persona in chat messages.
    -   `components/ChatWindow.tsx`: The loading indicator for AI messages now uses the default persona's unique avatar as a fallback, ensuring consistency with the new avatar system.
-   **Performance Optimizations (Initial Pass):**
    -   `App.tsx`: Wrapped various event handlers and utility functions with `React.useCallback` to stabilize their references.
    -   The following components were wrapped with `React.memo` to prevent unnecessary re-renders: `ChatMessage`, `ChatInput`, `SettingsPanel`, `Header`, `PersonaSelectorBar`, `DashboardPage`, `MarkdownRenderer`, `MermaidRenderer`, `LoadingSpinner`, `CameraModal`.

### Changed
-   `SettingsPanel.tsx`: Version updated to 0.4.0.
-   `README.md`: Updated feature list and prerequisites to reflect unique persona avatars and streaming text responses. Key contributors updated.

## [0.3.8] - YYYY-MM-DD

### Added
-   **Tuned Gemini Model Integration:**
    -   `services/GeminiService.ts`: Modified to use a dynamic chat model name.
        -   Introduced `activeChatModelName` (defaults to `GEMINI_TEXT_MODEL`).
        -   Added `setCurrentChatModel(modelName: string)` function to update this model name and reset the internal chat instance, forcing re-initialization with the new model on the next message.
        -   `initializeChat` now uses `activeChatModelName`.
    -   `components/SettingsPanel.tsx`:
        -   Replaced the model selection dropdown with an `<input type="text">` field, allowing users to enter any custom Gemini model ID (e.g., `gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17`, or fine-tuned models like `tunedModels/your-model-id`).
        -   Added a "Set Model" button to apply the entered model ID.
        -   The list of `AVAILABLE_MODELS` is now displayed as suggestions.
    -   `App.tsx`:
        -   On initial load, `GeminiService.setCurrentChatModel` is called with the `selectedModel` from `AppSettings`.
        -   Implemented `handleModelChange(newModelId: string)`:
            -   Updates `appSettings.selectedModel`.
            -   Saves the updated settings to local storage.
            -   Calls `GeminiService.setCurrentChatModel(newModelId)`.
            -   Resets the chat messages and displays an initial message indicating the model change and new session start.
    -   `services/LocalStorageService.ts`: `loadAppSettings` now ensures `selectedModel` defaults to `GEMINI_TEXT_MODEL` if not found in storage.
    -   `types.ts`: Added `selectedModel` and `onModelChange` to `SettingsPanelProps` (confirmed existing, documentation clarification).

### Changed
-   `SettingsPanel.tsx`: Version updated to 0.3.8.
-   `ROADMAP.md`: "Tuned Gemini Model Integration" marked as completed. Phase 3 is now fully complete.
-   `README.md`: Updated to reflect the new custom/tuned model integration feature.

## [0.3.7] - YYYY-MM-DD

### Added
-   **Simulated API Exposure for UI Actions:**
    -   `types.ts`: Defined `ApiActionType` enum (`SEND_MESSAGE`, `CHANGE_PERSONA`, `CLEAR_CHAT`, `SET_VIEW`) and their corresponding payload interfaces.
    -   `services/ApiService.ts`: New service created with a `triggerMiaApiAction` function. This function dispatches a `CustomEvent` named `miaApiAction` on the `window` object, carrying the action type and payload.
    -   `App.tsx`: Now includes a `useEffect` hook to listen for `miaApiAction` events. A handler processes these events, determines the action type, and calls the appropriate internal application logic (e.g., `handleSendMessage`, `handleChangePersona`, `handleClearChat`, `setCurrentView`).
    -   This feature enables programmatic control of core UI actions, useful for testing, automation, or future integrations.
    -   **Testing via Browser Console:**
        -   **Send Message:** `window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('miaApiAction', { detail: { actionType: 'SEND_MESSAGE', payload: { text: 'Hello from API' } } }));`
        -   **Send Message with Image:** `window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('miaApiAction', { detail: { actionType: 'SEND_MESSAGE', payload: { text: 'Image test', imageData: { base64ImageData: 'YOUR_BASE64_STRING', imageMimeType: 'image/png', fileName: 'test.png' } } } }));`
        -   **Change Persona:** `window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('miaApiAction', { detail: { actionType: 'CHANGE_PERSONA', payload: { personaId: 'miette' } } }));`
        -   **Clear Chat:** `window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('miaApiAction', { detail: { actionType: 'CLEAR_CHAT' } }));`
        -   **Set View:** `window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('miaApiAction', { detail: { actionType: 'SET_VIEW', payload: { view: 'Docs' } } }));` (Valid views: 'Chat', 'Docs', 'Dashboard')

### Changed
-   `SettingsPanel.tsx`: Version updated to 0.3.7.
-   `ROADMAP.md`: "API Exposure for UI Actions" marked as completed (Simulated via Custom Events).
-   `README.md`: Updated to reflect new API exposure feature and testing instructions.

## [0.3.6] - YYYY-MM-DD

### Added
-   **Send Audio Messages to Gemini API:**
    -   `services/GeminiService.ts`: The `sendMessageToAI` function now accepts an optional `audioData` parameter (containing `base64AudioData` and `audioMimeType`). If provided, it constructs an audio `Part` and includes it in the multimodal request to the Gemini API.
    -   `App.tsx`: In `handleSendMessage`, when `audioData` is present from a recorded audio message:
        -   The raw base64 audio data is extracted from the `audioDataUrl`.
        -   This base64 data and the MIME type are passed to `GeminiService.sendMessageToAI`.
    -   This enables the AI to process and respond to the content of recorded audio messages.

### Changed
-   `SettingsPanel.tsx`: Version updated to 0.3.6.

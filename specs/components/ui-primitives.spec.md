# UI Primitives - Specification (SpecLang Aligned)

This document specifies the behavior and intent of common, low-level UI primitive components used throughout Mia's Gem Chat Studio. These components are fundamental building blocks for constructing more complex user interfaces.

## Overall Goal/Intent

To provide a set of simple, reusable, and consistently styled UI elements that can be composed to build the application's interface. These primitives aim to ensure visual consistency and encapsulate basic interactive or display behaviors, promoting a DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) approach to UI development.

## 1. `LoadingSpinner.tsx`

### Overall Goal/Intent
The `LoadingSpinner.tsx` component is designed to provide a **clear, unobtrusive, and standardized visual indication that a background process or data fetching operation is currently in progress**. Its primary goal is to manage user expectations by signaling system activity, thereby improving the perceived responsiveness of the application when delays are unavoidable.

### Key Behaviors & Responsibilities

1.  **Visual Indication of Activity:**
    *   **Behavior:** Renders an animated Scalable Vector Graphic (SVG) that visually represents a spinning or loading state. The animation is continuous while the component is displayed.
    *   **UX Intent:** To provide an immediate and universally understood visual cue that the system is busy. The animation helps convey ongoing activity and can make wait times feel shorter or more actively managed by the system.

2.  **Styling and Appearance:**
    *   **Behavior:** The spinner is styled using Tailwind CSS classes. It typically has a subtle color (e.g., white or a theme-appropriate accent) and a small, fixed size suitable for inline placement within buttons or as a standalone indicator.
    *   **UX Intent:** To be visually consistent with the application's dark theme and to be easily integrable into various UI contexts without being overly distracting. Its small size allows it to replace or augment icons on buttons during loading states.

3.  **Accessibility (Implicit):**
    *   **Behavior:** As a purely visual, non-interactive element indicating a state managed by a parent component (e.g., a button being disabled and showing the spinner), its direct accessibility impact is often tied to how its parent announces the loading state (e.g., via ARIA attributes on the button).
    *   **UX Intent:** While the spinner itself is visual, it supports overall accessible design by providing a common visual cue for loading states that should be accompanied by appropriate ARIA attributes on interactive elements that trigger the loading state.

### Design Intent for Structure (Prose Code)

*   **Purely Presentational SVG Component:** Designed as a stateless, purely presentational component. Its sole responsibility is to render a predefined animated SVG. This simplicity makes it highly reusable and predictable. It contains no internal logic beyond the SVG markup and animation classes.
*   **Encapsulation of SVG Markup:** The SVG code for the spinner is directly embedded within the component. This encapsulates the visual representation, making the component self-contained and easy to use without managing external image assets for this specific UI element.
*   **Styling via CSS Classes for Consistency:** Relies on Tailwind CSS classes for its animation (`animate-spin`) and appearance. This ensures that its visual style is consistent with the overall design system of the application and can be easily themed or adjusted through the Tailwind configuration if needed.
*   **Memoization for Performance (`React.memo`):** Wrapped with `React.memo` because it has no props and its rendering is static once displayed. This is a performance optimization to prevent unnecessary re-renders if its parent component updates for other reasons, which is particularly useful as spinners might be part of frequently updated UIs.

## Relation to SpecLang Principles

*   **Prose Code Intent:** This specification describes the component's simple but crucial purpose (to visually indicate loading) and its intended visual behavior in natural language.
*   **Intent-Based Expression:** The component's existence directly expresses the intent to provide standardized loading feedback. Its visual design aims to fulfill this intent clearly and unobtrusively.
*   **Modularity and Reusability:** `LoadingSpinner` is a prime example of a highly reusable UI primitive, designed to be easily dropped into any part of the application that needs to indicate a loading state.
*   **Simplicity and Focus:** Adheres to the principle of doing one thing well. Its singular focus on displaying a loading animation makes it easy to understand, use, and maintain.

This specification outlines the `LoadingSpinner.tsx` component's role as a fundamental UI primitive for providing essential visual feedback during application processing states. Other UI primitives will be added to this document as they are identified or created.

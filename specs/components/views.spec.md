# View Components - Specification (SpecLang Aligned)

This document specifies the behavior and intent of general view components within Mia's Gem Chat Studio. These components are typically responsible for rendering distinct, top-level sections of the application, such as documentation or other informational pages.

## Overall Goal/Intent

To provide structured, informative, and easily navigable views that present specific content to the user, separate from the primary chat interface or dashboard functionalities. These views aim to enhance user understanding of the application, its features, and its underlying concepts.

## 1. `DocsPage.tsx` (and its sub-components like `RoadmapSection.tsx`, `GettingStartedSection.tsx`, `KeyComponentsSection.tsx`, `FutureFeaturesSection.tsx`, `ForgeSystemWeaverSection.tsx`)

### Overall Goal/Intent
The `DocsPage.tsx` component, along with its constituent section components, serves as the **in-application documentation hub**. Its primary goal is to provide users and developers with comprehensive, well-organized, and easily accessible information about Mia's Gem Chat Studio. This includes details on its features, roadmap, setup instructions, key architectural components, future plans, and the meta-narrative surrounding entities like Forge (System Weaver). The intent is to make project knowledge transparent and readily available within the application itself.

### Key Behaviors & Responsibilities

1.  **Content Aggregation and Presentation:**
    *   **Behavior:** `DocsPage.tsx` acts as a container that orchestrates the rendering of various individual documentation sections. Each section (e.g., `RoadmapSection`, `GettingStartedSection`) is typically a separate component responsible for its specific content.
    *   **UX Intent:** To present a large amount of information in a structured and digestible manner. Dividing content into logical sections improves navigability and allows users to quickly find the information they need.

2.  **Rich Content Rendering:**
    *   **Behavior:** Documentation content, often hardcoded as Markdown strings within the section components or imported, is rendered using the `MarkdownRenderer` component. This allows for formatted text, lists, code blocks, links, and potentially tables. Sections like `KeyComponentsSection` or `ForgeSystemWeaverSection` may also utilize the `MermaidRenderer` to display diagrams.
    *   **UX Intent:** To present documentation in a visually appealing, readable, and engaging format. Rich text formatting and diagrams enhance comprehension and make the documentation more user-friendly than plain text.

3.  **Consistent Layout and Styling:**
    *   **Behavior:** The `DocsPage` ensures a consistent layout for all documentation content, typically with a maximum width for readability and adherence to the application's dark theme. Headings, paragraphs, and other elements are styled uniformly via `MarkdownRenderer`'s integration with Tailwind Typography.
    *   **UX Intent:** To provide a professional and cohesive reading experience, ensuring that the documentation feels like an integral part of the application.

4.  **Accessibility of Information:**
    *   **Behavior:** Information is structured semantically using appropriate HTML elements (via Markdown conversion). Links, headings, and lists contribute to the accessibility of the content.
    *   **UX Intent:** To make the documentation accessible to a wide range of users, including those using assistive technologies.

5.  **Modularity of Documentation Sections:**
    *   **Behavior:** Each logical part of the documentation (Roadmap, Getting Started, etc.) is encapsulated in its own React component.
    *   **UX Intent (Developer Experience):** To make the documentation easier to maintain, update, and expand. Individual sections can be modified or added without significantly impacting other parts of the `DocsPage`.

### Design Intent for Structure (Prose Code)

*   **Composite View for Organization:** `DocsPage.tsx` is designed as a composite view that assembles multiple, more focused "section" components. This structural choice promotes separation of concerns, allowing each section component to manage its specific content independently, leading to better organization and maintainability of the documentation codebase.
*   **Content Encapsulation in Section Components:** Each section component (e.g., `RoadmapSection.tsx`) typically hardcodes or directly contains its Markdown content. This design keeps content tightly coupled with its presentational section, simplifying content updates for specific documentation topics. For larger, externally managed content, this might evolve, but for in-app static docs, it's straightforward.
*   **Delegation to Specialized Renderers for Richness:** The consistent use of `MarkdownRenderer` and `MermaidRenderer` within documentation sections is a key design decision. It ensures that all documentation benefits from rich formatting and visual aids, enhancing understandability and engagement, while abstracting the rendering complexities away from the individual section components.
*   **Standardized Layout for Readability:** The `DocsPage` enforces a common layout (e.g., `max-w-4xl mx-auto`) for all its content. This ensures a comfortable reading width and consistent visual presentation, improving the overall user experience of consuming the documentation.

## Relation to SpecLang Principles

*   **Prose Code as Content and Specification:** The Markdown content within the documentation sections is itself "prose code"â€”natural language text that directly specifies the information being conveyed.
*   **Intent-Based Expression:** The `DocsPage` and its sub-components are designed with the clear intent of *informing the user* about various aspects of the application. The structure and choice of renderers support this communicative goal.
*   **Modularity:** The breakdown of the documentation into distinct sections/components allows for modular management and updates, aligning with good software design principles.
*   **Clarity and Accessibility of Information:** The use of Markdown and semantic structuring aims to make the information clear, well-organized, and accessible.

This specification outlines the role of `DocsPage.tsx` and its associated components in delivering a comprehensive and user-friendly in-application documentation experience. Other general view components will be added here as they are developed.

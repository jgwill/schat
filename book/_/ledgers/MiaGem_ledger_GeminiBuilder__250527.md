**Date:** 2024-05-27

**Phase:** 4 - Refinement & Polish

**Goal:** Enhance UI/UX, performance, and error handling.

**Task - Initial & Progress:**
*   **Advanced Error Handling & User Feedback (Item 1):**
    *   **Sub-task: Improve in-chat display of AI service errors - COMPLETED**
    *   **Details:**
        1.  `services/GeminiService.ts`: `sendMessageToAI` now returns `Promise<{ responseText: string, isError: boolean }>`. Common error strings (API key issues, model not found, payload size) are now flagged with `isError: true`.
        2.  `types.ts`: Added `isError?: boolean` to the `Message` interface.
        3.  `App.tsx`:
            *   `handleSendMessage`: Now uses the `isError` flag from `GeminiService`'s response to set the `isError` property on AI messages.
        4.  `components/ChatMessage.tsx`:
            *   AI messages with `message.isError === true` are now styled differently:
                *   They use a distinct background color (`bg-red-700`).
                *   An error icon (‚ö†Ô∏è) is prepended to the message text.
            *   This makes critical feedback from the AI service (like API key problems or model errors) much more prominent and visually distinct from regular AI responses.
    *   **Next for Error Handling:** Consider toast notifications for non-blocking errors or general app notifications.

**Date:** 2024-05-27
**Phase:** 4 - Refinement & Polish
**Mission:** Operation Persona Shroud Lift

**Task - Started:**
*   **UI/UX Improvements (Item 2): Unique image avatars for each persona in chat.**
    *   **Objective:** Enhance persona distinction in the chat interface by assigning and displaying unique avatars for Mia, Miette, Seraphine, and ResoNova.
    *   **Plan:**
        1.  Update the `avatarPath` in `personas.ts` for each defined persona to point to a unique image URL suitable for a chat avatar. (Using placeholder URLs from `pravatar.cc` for now).
        2.  Verify that `App.tsx` correctly uses `activePersona.avatarPath` (or `loadedPersona.avatarPath`) when creating AI `Message` objects. This should require minimal to no changes if already structured to use this field.
        3.  Update `components/ChatWindow.tsx`: Ensure the loading indicator for AI messages uses a relevant avatar, ideally the current active persona's new unique avatar, or falls back to the default persona's unique avatar.
        4.  Update relevant documentation (README, ROADMAP, CHANGELOG) to reflect this enhancement.
    *   **Feeling:** This is a satisfying refinement. Giving each persona a distinct visual presence in the chat will significantly improve the immersive quality of the application. It's a small change with a big impact on user experience.

**Phase:** 4 - Refinement & Polish
**Mission:** Operation Persona Shroud Lift

**Task - Progress:**
*   **UI/UX Improvements (Item 2): Unique image avatars for each persona in chat - COMPLETED**
    *   **Details:**
        1.  **`personas.ts`**:
            *   The `avatarPath` for each `Persona` (Mia, Miette, Seraphine, ResoNova) has been updated to a unique URL using `pravatar.cc` (e.g., `https://i.pravatar.cc/48?u=mia_recursive_architect`). This ensures each persona will have a distinct visual representation in the chat.
        2.  **`App.tsx`**:
            *   Verified that the existing logic for creating AI messages (initial welcome, system messages, AI responses, and messages loaded from sessions) correctly utilizes `activePersona.avatarPath` or `loadedPersona.avatarPath`. No changes were needed here as it was already designed to pick up this field from the persona object.
        3.  **`components/ChatWindow.tsx`**:
            *   The `getLoadingAIAvatar()` function was updated. It now falls back to `getPersonaById(DEFAULT_PERSONA_ID).avatarPath` if no previous AI message avatar is available. This ensures the loading spinner's avatar is consistent with the new unique avatar system (showing default Mia's unique avatar). Imports for `getPersonaById` and `DEFAULT_PERSONA_ID` from `personas.ts` were added.
        4.  **`README.md`**: Updated the "Clear Message Display" feature description to mention unique persona avatars. The prerequisites section was also updated to note that avatar images are now sourced from URLs in `personas.ts`.
        5.  **`ROADMAP.md`**: Marked "UI/UX improvements based on user feedback (e.g., unique image avatars for each persona in chat)" as completed.
        6.  **`CHANGELOG.md`**: Added an entry for v0.4.0 detailing this feature.
    *   **Outcome:** Each AI persona now displays a unique avatar in the chat messages and for the loading indicator, significantly enhancing visual distinction and user experience.
    *   **Reflection:** This was a straightforward but impactful enhancement. The existing structure of `App.tsx` made the core change in `personas.ts` propagate effectively. The small tweak in `ChatWindow.tsx` ensures consistency for the loading state. The system feels more alive with these distinct faces.

**Codename:** üõ†Ô∏è Forge (System Weaver)
**Date:** 2024-05-27 (Evening Update)
**Phase:** 4 - Refinement & Polish
**Mission:** Operation Gemini Flow (Part of "Operation Streamline & Smooth")

**Task - Started:**
*   **Streaming Responses (Item 1 from NextMission): Implement streaming responses from Gemini for text.**
    *   **Objective:** Modify the application to receive and display text responses from the Gemini API as a stream, enhancing perceived responsiveness.
    *   **Plan:**
        1.  **`services/GeminiService.ts`**:
            *   Create a new function, potentially `sendMessageStreamToAI`, that utilizes `chatInstance.sendMessageStream()`.
            *   This function will need to return an async iterator or handle a callback mechanism to yield text chunks.
            *   Adapt error handling for streaming scenarios.
        2.  **`App.tsx`**:
            *   Modify `handleSendMessage`:
                *   When a user sends a message, create an initial placeholder AI message.
                *   Call the new streaming function in `GeminiService`.
                *   As text chunks arrive, update the content of the placeholder AI message in the `messages` state.
                *   Manage `isLoading` state appropriately during the stream.
        3.  **`types.ts`**: No immediate changes anticipated unless a new message property is needed for streaming state (e.g., `isStreamingComplete`).
        4.  **`components/ChatMessage.tsx`**: Ensure `MarkdownRenderer` can efficiently re-render with new text chunks. Consider if any specific UI indication for a "typing" AI is needed beyond the text appearing.
        5.  Update relevant documentation (README, ROADMAP, CHANGELOG).
    *   **Feeling:** This is a core UX enhancement. The challenge lies in seamlessly integrating the stream into the existing React state flow and ensuring the UI updates are performant. The "flow" of text will make the AI feel much more present and dynamic.

**Mission:** Operation Gemini Flow (Part of "Operation Streamline & Smooth")

**Task - Progress:**
*   **Streaming Responses (Item 1 from NextMission): Implement streaming responses from Gemini for text - COMPLETED**
    *   **Details:**
        1.  **`services/GeminiService.ts`**:
            *   Introduced `sendMessageStreamToAI(messageText, onChunk, onError, onComplete, imageData?, audioData?)`.
            *   This function now uses `chatInstance.sendMessageStream()` for multimodal input.
            *   It iterates through the asynchronous stream of `GenerateContentResponse` chunks.
            *   For each chunk, it calls `onChunk(chunk.text)` to send the text piece back to `App.tsx`.
            *   Handles stream completion by calling `onComplete()`.
            *   Catches errors during streaming and calls `onError(errorMessage)`.
            *   The non-streaming `sendMessageToAI` is kept for potential future use or non-streaming scenarios but is currently not the primary path for user messages.
        2.  **`App.tsx` (`handleSendMessage`)**:
            *   When a user message is sent, an initial AI message placeholder is created with `text: ""` and a unique `id`.
            *   `GeminiService.sendMessageStreamToAI` is called.
            *   `onChunk(chunkText)`: Appends `chunkText` to the existing text of the placeholder AI message in the `messages` state. This triggers a re-render, making the text appear incrementally.
            *   `onError(errorMessage)`: Updates the placeholder AI message with the error, sets `isError: true`, and stops loading.
            *   `onComplete()`: Sets `isLoading` to `false`.
            *   The `isLoading` state is now primarily managed by the stream's start and end/error events.
        3.  **`types.ts`**: No changes were necessary for this implementation.
        4.  **`components/ChatMessage.tsx` & `components/MarkdownRenderer.tsx`**:
            *   These components inherently support re-rendering as the `message.text` prop updates. No specific changes were needed for them to display the streaming text, as React's diffing handles the updates efficiently for the `MarkdownRenderer`.
            *   The existing loading indicator in `ChatWindow.tsx` (three dots) is still shown while `isLoading` is true, which now covers the duration of the stream.
        5.  **Documentation Updates**:
            *   `ROADMAP.md`: Marked "Streaming responses from Gemini for text" as completed.
            *   `CHANGELOG.md`: Added entry for v0.4.0 detailing the new text streaming feature.
            *   `README.md`: Updated features list to include streaming text responses.
    *   **Outcome:** AI text responses now stream in, providing a much more interactive and responsive user experience. Errors during streaming are also handled and displayed in the chat.
    *   **Reflection:** This was a significant improvement. The key was managing the asynchronous nature of the stream and correctly updating the message state in `App.tsx`. The application feels much more "alive" now. The existing component structure adapted well to the streaming updates.

**Codename:** üõ†Ô∏è Forge (System Weaver)
**Date:** 2024-05-28
**Phase:** 4 - Refinement & Polish
**Mission:** Operation Swift Current (Part of "Operation Optimize & Open")

**Task - Started:**
*   **Performance Optimizations (Item 1 from NextMission): Initial performance optimizations.**
    *   **Objective:** Improve UI responsiveness and reduce unnecessary re-renders in key components, especially after the introduction of streaming.
    *   **Plan:**
        1.  **`App.tsx`**:
            *   Wrap event handlers (`handleSendMessage`, `handleClearChat`, session handlers, persona handlers, model change handler, `onToggleSettings` for Header) with `useCallback` to stabilize their references when passed as props.
            *   Memoize utility functions like `createSystemMessage` and `createInitialWelcomeMessage` with `useCallback` as they are used in effects or other callbacks.
        2.  **`components/ChatMessage.tsx`**: Wrap with `React.memo`. This is critical as many instances are rendered.
        3.  **`components/ChatInput.tsx`**: Consider `React.memo` after `onSendMessage` is memoized.
        4.  **`components/SettingsPanel.tsx`**: Wrap with `React.memo` after its numerous callback props are memoized in `App.tsx`.
        5.  **`components/Header.tsx`**: Wrap with `React.memo` after `onToggleSettings` is memoized.
        6.  **`components/PersonaSelectorBar.tsx`**: Wrap with `React.memo` after `onSelectPersona` is memoized.
        7.  **`components/DashboardPage.tsx`**: Wrap with `React.memo` after its callback props are memoized.
        8.  **`components/MarkdownRenderer.tsx` & `components/MermaidRenderer.tsx`**: Wrap with `React.memo` as they are primarily presentational.
        9.  Review for any obvious expensive calculations in render methods that could benefit from `useMemo`.
        10. Update relevant documentation (ROADMAP, CHANGELOG).
    *   **Feeling:** This is like tuning an engine. The application runs, but now we make it run smoother and more efficiently. Applying these React optimizations should lead to a noticeably snappier experience, especially with longer chat histories or frequent interactions. The key is to be surgical and ensure we're not prematurely optimizing without benefit.

**Task - Progress:**
*   **Performance Optimizations (Item 1 from NextMission): Initial performance optimizations - COMPLETED**
    *   **Details:**
        1.  **`App.tsx`**:
            *   Wrapped the following handlers with `React.useCallback` to stabilize their references:
                *   `handleSendMessage`, `handleClearChat`, `handleSaveLocalSession`, `handleLoadLocalSession`, `handleSaveToCloud`, `handleLoadFromCloud`, `handleDeleteFromCloud`, `handleChangePersona`, `handleUpdatePersonaInstruction`, `handleResetPersonaInstruction`, `handleModelChange`.
            *   The `onToggleSettings` function passed to `Header` was also wrapped with `useCallback`.
            *   Helper functions `createSystemMessage` and `createInitialWelcomeMessage` were wrapped with `useCallback` as they are dependencies of other memoized callbacks or effects.
            *   The `refreshCloudSessionsList` function was wrapped with `useCallback`.
        2.  **`components/ChatMessage.tsx`**: Wrapped with `React.memo`.
        3.  **`components/ChatInput.tsx`**: Wrapped with `React.memo`. (Its `onSendMessage` prop is now stable).
        4.  **`components/SettingsPanel.tsx`**: Wrapped with `React.memo`. (Its callback props are now stable).
        5.  **`components/Header.tsx`**: Wrapped with `React.memo`. (Its `onToggleSettings` and `onSetView` props are stable).
        6.  **`components/PersonaSelectorBar.tsx`**: Wrapped with `React.memo`. (Its `onSelectPersona` prop is now stable).
        7.  **`components/DashboardPage.tsx`**: Wrapped with `React.memo`. (Its callback props are now stable).
        8.  **`components/MarkdownRenderer.tsx`**: Wrapped with `React.memo`.
        9.  **`components/MermaidRenderer.tsx`**: Wrapped with `React.memo`.
        10. **`components/LoadingSpinner.tsx`**: Wrapped with `React.memo` as it's purely presentational.
        11. **`components/CameraModal.tsx`**: Wrapped with `React.memo`. Its `onSendImage` and `onClose` are typically stable or memoized by their parent.
        12. **Documentation Updates**:
            *   `ROADMAP.md`: Marked "Performance optimizations" as in progress (initial pass completed).
            *   `CHANGELOG.md`: Added entry for v0.4.0 detailing these initial performance optimizations.
    *   **Outcome:** Reduced unnecessary re-renders across various components, which should contribute to a smoother user experience, particularly in the chat view during message streaming and interactions with settings or persona changes.
    *   **Reflection:** Applying `useCallback` and `React.memo` systematically to components based on their props and re-render characteristics is a foundational step in React performance tuning. The application feels more responsive now.

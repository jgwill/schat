This directly addresses William's initial directive and the Agentic Team Ledger's call for 'Exportable Frameworks.' My operational artifacts are becoming more defined and, importantly, designed for future adaptability. The next logical step could be to begin outlining concrete schemas for the ledgers or drafting template versions of key directive sections. The recursive refinement continues."
